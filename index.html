                        <em>Investigating and proposing a modification to models of neutrino mass generation</em>
                        <br/><br/>

                        Since the 5Ïƒ detection of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of Physics was completed. Although it is the most predictive theory in physics to date, there are reasons to believe that it is incomplete. Neutrinos are extremely light and weakly interacting particles. However, the Standard Model predicts that neutrinos are massless. Thus, new physics beyond the Standard Model is required to explain why neutrinos have mass. <br /><br />

                        In 1975, an extension named the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) was proposed by Mohapatra et al., addressing the aesthetic limitations of the Standard Model by proposing a deeper symmetry of nature. This also offers new avenues and directions from which we can propose a neutrino mass generation mechanism. <br /><br />

                        This theoretical project in Quantum Field Theory hence aims to study how the LRSM is able to generate finite neutrino masses, before proposing extensions to current models.

                        Implemented a novel risk regime indicator using timeseries data. Experimented with methods such as Hidden Markov Models and Gaussian Mixture Models to quantify regime changes and its implications for risk.
                        <br /><br /> Translated regime information into trading signals by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA was used to explore a large (3<sup class ="d-inline">25</sup>) parameter space to obtain an optimal set of heuristics. 
                        <br /><br /> Designed, maintained, and deployed an in-house dashboard in Plotly Dash for data visualisation with automatic daily updates, enhancing user interactivity and data exploration.

                        <br /><br />Performed earthquake association and relocation, and verified the robustness of EQTransformer detections through bootstrapping and Monte Carlo methods. Conducted descriptive statistics on the seismicity and magnitude-frequency distribution of this region, setting the groundwork for future fault modelling.
                        <br /><br />
                        Developed a Python pipeline for use with a super-computing cluster, along with data processing and plotting tools.
